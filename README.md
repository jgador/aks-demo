# Deploying and Managing .NET Applications with Kubernetes

Welcome to the repository for the "Deploying and Managing .NET Applications with Kubernetes" demo, presented at the Cebu Microsoft Tech Users Group. In this demo, we explore the deployment and management of .NET applications using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This session provides a comprehensive introduction to Kubernetes and how it can be leveraged to streamline the deployment process for .NET applications.

## Azure Resources

To set up AKS, the following Azure resources are required:

1. **Resource Group**: `rg-demo`
