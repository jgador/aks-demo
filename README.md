# Deploying and Managing .NET Applications with Kubernetes

Welcome to the repository for the "Deploying and Managing .NET Applications with Kubernetes" demo, presented at the Cebu Microsoft Tech Users Group. In this demo, we explore the deployment and management of .NET applications using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This session provides an introduction to Kubernetes and how it can be leveraged to streamline the deployment process for .NET applications.

## Azure Resources

To set up AKS, the following Azure resources are required:

1. **Resource Group**: `rg-demo`
2. **Virtual Network**: `vnet-aks-demo`
3. **Log Analytics Workspace**: `log-aks-demo`

## Utilizing ASP.NET Core Identity

Instead of using a sample web app that typically displays a homepage, we will utilize ASP.NET Core Identity. This approach allows us to be more productive by implementing authentication and user management features within our .NET application.
